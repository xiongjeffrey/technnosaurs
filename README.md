DATABASE MANAGEMENT

We get a sample of pics from each photographer and tag the photos with some set of available characteristics. Each photographer has their own entry that is updated with each photo's tags as they're inputted. Each photographer receives their own ID that the photo information can be pulled with. People can also add their own tags that future photos can be tagged with and current photos can be updated with as well.
